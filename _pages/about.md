Hi there! I am a computer scientist broadly interested in Operating systems ...

<!-- I am a PhD student at [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) for Software Systems, in Kaiserslautern. 

I am working in the Real-time Systems group with [BjÃ¶rn B. Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/), specifically for the [TOROS](https://toros.mpi-sws.org/) project. I am interested in operating systems and my current project is focused on trace-based response-time analysis on Linux. -->

My research
