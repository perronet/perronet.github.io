Hi there! I am a computer scientist broadly interested in operating systems, networks and distributed systems. I am currently working as a PhD student in the Real-Time Systems group with [Bj√∂rn B. Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/) at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/).

My research in a nutshell
------

Real-time systems are systems in which not only functional correctness is important, but also timing correctness (for example, airplanes and cars). To ensure timing correctness, timing analyses have been developed. My project, **RBFtrace**, aims to build a tool to apply timing analysis at runtime on Linux systems. 

More broadly, my research is focused on operating systems: the final goal of RBFtrace is to be part of the novel real-time operating system [TOROS](https://toros.mpi-sws.org/). Part of the mission of TOROS is to ensure, by design, that the temporal behavior of the system can be analyzed without requiring the user to have real-time expertise.
