Hi there! I am a computer scientist broadly interested in operating systems, networks and distributed systems. I am currently working as a PhD student in the Real-Time Systems group with [Bj√∂rn B. Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/) at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/).

My research in a nutshell
------

I work in the field of real-time systems. In any system, functional correctness is important, but in a real-time system also timing correctness is essential. Real-time systems are typically safety-critical systems where timing bugs can have catastrophic consequences (for example, airplanes and cars). To ensure timing correctness, timing analyses have been developed.

My team is working on the novel real-time operating system [TOROS](https://toros.mpi-sws.org/). Part of the mission of TOROS is to ensure, by design, that timing analysis is used to analyze the system behavior without requiring the user to have real-time expertise. To this end, my team works on many different sub-projects. My project, **RBFtrace**, aims to build a tool to apply timing analysis at runtime on Linux systems. The final goal is to port RBFtrace and make it become part of TOROS.
